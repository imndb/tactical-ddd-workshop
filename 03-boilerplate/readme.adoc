= Lab Instructions

This build module contains a sample project to showcase how to use the jMolecules ByteBuddy integration to avoid boilerplate code to map a domain model to a database using JPA.
To verify everything continues to work as expected during our refactoring we can run `PersistentModelTests` after each step.

== Add Stereotype Interfaces

In this step we add the jMolecules DDD stereotype interface to the codebase to assign individual model elements to Domain-Driven Design building blocks.
While this primarily makes our code more expressive and allows verification shown in module 1, it also enables the boilerplate code generation in the following steps.

. Search for all `TODO: 10` tags in the codebase and uncomment the additional type declarations.
. Execute `PersistentModelTests` to verify everything still works as expected

== Activate ByteBuddy Code Generation

. Find all `TODO: 20` tags.
. Uncomment additional dependencies and the build plugin `pom.xml`
. Execute project build and see the jMolecules' log output skipping transformations as it still finds the explicit annotations on our model types.
. Execute `PersistentModelTests` to verify everything still works as expected.

== Remove Obsolete JPA Annotations and Artifacts

. For each model type, find all `TODO: 30` tags
** Remove the corresponding type and field JPA annotations:
** Also, get rid of all Lombok annotations that created code to satisfy JPA requirements, such as no-argument constructors.
** Remove the `Serializable` implementation from all `Identifier` implementations (including the declaration of the `serialVersionUID` field).
** Finally, replace the `CustomerId customer` property in `Order` with `Association<Customer, CustomerId>` and replace the assignment with a call to `Association.forId(â€¦)`.
. Execute `PersistentModelTests` to verify everything still works as expected.

== Replace Identifiers and Value Objects with Java Records

Hibernate 6 supports custom instantiators for embeddable types and Hibernate 6.2 has extended that support to embeddable identifiers.
For Java records, the jMolcules ByteBuddy plugin can generate such an `EmbeddableInstantiator` (see `RecordInstantiator` in `jmolecules-spring`).
This allows us to get rid of the custom value type implementations and simplify the declaration of identifiers.

. For all value objects, find the `TODO: 40` tags and replace the class declarations with record ones.

== Replace Spring Data Repository Interfaces with jMolecules ones

. Find all `TODO: 50` tags and fix them as instructed.
In particular, replace the references to Spring Data repository interfaces with ones from jMolecules.
See how the compile log shows those interfaces to additionally extend the Spring Data interfaces.
